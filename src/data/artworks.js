  bio: [
    "I am a digital artist based in the clouds, obsessed with the texture of oil paint and the infinite possibilities of pixels. My work explores the intersection of classic romanticism and futuristic surrealism.",
    "When I'm not painting, I'm researching color theory or drinking too much coffee. I believe art should not just be seen, but felt—a fleeting emotion captured in a static frame."
